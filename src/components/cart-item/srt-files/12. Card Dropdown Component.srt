1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:06,890
Now that we have our car icon component let's start building our car dropdown.

2
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:11,750
So if we look at our dropdown we know that there is a container.

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,930
There is this section with items inside that a scroll level.

4
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:25,610
And there's also a go to checkout button and it opens and is seemingly stuck to that area just underneath

5
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:27,920
our cart icon.

6
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,740
So let's start building this component.

7
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:39,940
The first thing we're going to do is we are going to create a cart component here.

8
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:48,920
We'll just call it cart and inside of it actually let's call it cart dropdown.

9
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:53,060
It's a bit more direct about what it is.

10
00:00:53,130 --> 00:01:01,980
So we're going to create our cart dropdown component Dutch assets as well as our cart dropdown dot styles

11
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:08,440
DOT says we are gonna import react from react.

12
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:14,370
And we're also going to import in our custom button because we know we need one at the very end

13
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:32,370
or import in our style sheet and what we're going to use for our component is a regular stateless component

14
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:48,920
and inside will be a containing do with the class name of cart dropdown and also this div that has the

15
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:56,090
class name of our cart items because this will be the thing that contains our cart items which will

16
00:01:56,090 --> 00:02:00,830
keep empty for now and then our custom button

17
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:19,440
and we will say go to checkout on the inside and here we will export t fault our cart dropdown cart

18
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,360
dropped it.

19
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:36,470
Now let's bring in our style sheet so I have the styles here for you as well for this component and

20
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:42,600
I'm pushing the margin top of auto for our button so that it's always at the bottom.

21
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:51,690
The car items takes up 240 pixels it aligns everything inside so that it flows vertically and it has

22
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:56,350
an oversight flow of scroll but we won't create car items just yet.

23
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:05,420
We have to bring our cart dropdown into our header component and we got to import in our cart dropdown

24
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:05,900
component

25
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:19,350
cart dropdown cart dropdown component and we're going to place it just outside of our options div because

26
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:24,570
we want it to sit just outside of that div.

27
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:32,190
So now if we go back to our application we'll see it right there awesome.

28
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:41,750
OK now what we have to do is conditionally show or hide this card dropdown and to do so we are going

29
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:52,840
to trigger something that will show or hide this component based off of some true or false value.

30
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:59,810
Now we are going to create a cart reducer to do this and we're going to set the value of some property

31
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:08,390
probably called Hidden on that reducer based on clicking this icon because maybe there are other ways

32
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:15,050
that we want to hide this in the future we don't know but what we do want to do is we want to keep that

33
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:23,150
in our global state in case anywhere else wants to trigger the ability to hide or show our dropdown.

34
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:24,440
So let's implement that.
