Hello It's Andre here again.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:09,930
I want you to notice what e whore has been doing so far and he's going to continue to do throughout

3
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:14,670
the course that is he's writing extensible code.

4
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:21,090
Are you starting to feel like we're doing a lot of things over and over the same way we're creating

5
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:29,550
reduced hours and actions and selectors and connecting components and rendering components and if things

6
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,450
seem repetitive to you.

7
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:40,830
That's actually a good thing because what we're doing is we're making things very simple now we're creating

8
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:48,930
a lot of files in our project but these files are all usually under one hundred lines of code each file

9
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:52,200
is very very simple isn't it.

10
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:56,950
We haven't been any crazy long thousand line algorithms.

11
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:00,220
Everything is nice small and simple.

12
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:09,100
And if you notice each one makes each component very very small and also very extensible that is he

13
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:17,650
reuses components and features across the application so that he's not constantly doing the same thing

14
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:26,710
over and over it's OK if we're copying code that is well similar in let's say a selector or using map

15
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:29,170
state to props over and over.

16
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:36,250
The idea is that he's structured the project in such a way that your eye could come to the project and

17
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:43,620
really easily add features really easily add a custom button or a cart item.

18
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:51,430
And this is a sign of a really good developer because when he's coding He's coding for the future as

19
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:51,980
well.

20
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:58,360
He knows that by thinking a little bit about how to make the code more extensible in the future he'll

21
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:04,570
benefit as he takes on more and more features because he can use the same functionality in one part

22
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:12,400
of the app in another part of the app and react and Redux really allows us to create extensible code

23
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,660
and the other word that you might be thinking of is also predictable code.

24
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,700
There's nothing hard about what we're doing right now.

25
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:27,360
Everything is super easy and predictable at least it is once you get used to the react redux syntax.

26
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:33,840
But at the end of the day we're just creating really declarative code really predictable pure functions

27
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:42,120
that can be extended so keep an eye on that throughout the course because this is why you want to do.

28
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:48,780
You don't want to make code that makes you look impressive or clever or tough you want code so simple

29
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,080
that anybody can read it let's keep going.
