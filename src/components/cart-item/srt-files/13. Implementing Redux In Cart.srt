1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:08,490
So now that we have our car icon component and our cart dropdown component we have to figure out how

2
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:16,770
to trigger our cart dropdown to hide and show based off clicking the cart icon.

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:24,300
Now you might be wondering if we could just find that functionality into our head our component because

4
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:31,200
both these components are here and using our local component state we could possibly add an on click

5
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:38,880
handler here that updates a state value on our header that sets it to true or false.

6
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:43,930
And then based off of that true false value we just hide or show this car dropdown.

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:51,600
And that would be entirely valid if we were certain that the only way we wanted to hide or show our

8
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,940
car dropdown was within our head our component.

9
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,300
But because we are not sure of that.

10
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:04,020
Perhaps we want to show or hide our car dropdown in another component.

11
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:11,580
We want to move that functionality and that capability outside of the header component and inside of

12
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,420
our global redux state.

13
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:16,130
Now how do we do that.

14
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:23,090
Well first let's create the redux files and they'll look very similar to our user files.

15
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:27,880
So instead of user or call it cart we'll make a cart.

16
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:36,220
Actions that J us a cart dot reducer dodgy us and a cart dot type stuff.

17
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:43,200
J ust now starting with our reducer we know that we need an initial state

18
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:53,920
where the hidden value is true because we want to hide our dropdown when they first comes to our Web

19
00:01:53,920 --> 00:02:04,840
site then we're going to have our cart reducer equal to a function where state is equal to our initial

20
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,400
state.

21
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,060
If no value comes in.

22
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:15,730
So default value of initial state and then our action and using a switch statement on the action date

23
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:29,060
type we will now selectively render with a case of let's say toggle cart hidden.

24
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:38,510
The reason why we want to use a toggle versus a set is because our cart component will either be in

25
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:39,620
a true or false state.

26
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:42,780
So it's either hidden or not hidden right.

27
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:47,420
And we know that we're mainly switching it back and forth between true and false.

28
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:56,000
So instead of passing in a value for our actions our payload what we can actually do is we can say hidden

29
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,240
is equal to state to hit it.

30
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:05,930
So that exclamation mark is saying that whatever this boolean value is I want you to convert it to the

31
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:07,360
opposite of it.

32
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:07,700
Right.

33
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:15,520
So if it's true or to be false if it's false I want it to be true and then by default we want to return

34
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:19,110
just the state.

35
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:23,980
Now this of course is a string but we want to make an action type for it.

36
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:28,120
So let's go to our car dot actions and let's export default

37
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:39,270
heart action types where toggle card hidden goes to the string toggle car hidden.

38
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:45,280
And now we just need to import that from our car types

39
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,970
and it will be cart action types

40
00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:03,130
toggle card hidden and we'll export out our reducer as the default.

41
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:05,190
So now we have our code

42
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:23,180
oh maybe I got to move this down here sometimes our lender yells at us now to make the actual oh wait

43
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:24,020
i move it.

44
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:32,100
Oh sorry I put this in the wrong file cart types my that wrong file that all that that's definitely

45
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,260
confusing the file the file naming conventions.

46
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:39,180
It's a thing that always used to throw me off when I was first learning read.

47
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:39,360
OK.

48
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:43,790
So definitely don't feel bad because we all make these mistakes.

49
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:48,560
Now the cart action we actually need to make the action now.

50
00:04:48,590 --> 00:05:00,450
So let's import in our car action types from car types and what our value will be.

51
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:06,460
We will set it as X export concert toggle cart.

52
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:09,930
Hidden is equal to a function.

53
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:13,280
And we're not going to pass a payload because we don't need one.

54
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:16,640
We're just going to set type equal to cart action types.

55
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:27,530
Dot toggle cart hit in payload is actually an optional property on our action object and inside of a

56
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:32,800
reducer we're not actually using the payload inside of this respective case.

57
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:33,160
Right.

58
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,960
So there's no need for us to pass a payload.

59
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:40,980
We just need to know that if it's of this type we're just going to switch it from whatever its previous

60
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:48,970
state was to its opposite state and now inside of cart icon.

61
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:58,890
Let's find that action here so let's import connect from react redux.

62
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:01,300
Let's bring in our action type

63
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,090
part action.

64
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:24,540
Toggle car hit an and we need our map dispatch to props which gets a dispatch and we're gonna call it

65
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:34,050
toggle cart hidden will just be a function that triggers the dispatch of toggle cart hit.

66
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:39,190
And now we'll pass this into our connect function.

67
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:53,110
Passing know as the default so now we'll be able to access toggle cart hit in here and we can just find

68
00:06:53,110 --> 00:07:06,250
it on click like so and now if we look we'll see that we fire the action now of course our state is

69
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:16,360
updating oh we actually have to add our cart reducer to our route reducer so that's a step that we always

70
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:24,390
got to remember so cart reducer from our cart cart producer.

71
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:34,110
This is another common mistake that we make when we first start using redux as well as that we'll forget

72
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:39,530
to port and add our cart to our cart reducer.

73
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:46,940
So now if we look we'll see that our cart by default is hit and true if we click it we'll see that now

74
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,380
it's false.

75
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:53,320
So now we just have to hide and show this dropdown based off of that value.

76
00:07:53,570 --> 00:08:02,380
So let's go back to our header component and we'll impart in O where we have our maps data props.

77
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:08,090
So what we need to do structure off of our state is also now the cart and then the hidden value.

78
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:16,040
So I'm actually going to show you more advanced way to D structure as well so off of our state we want

79
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:20,040
the user and off the user we want the current user.

80
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:26,210
So this is the syntax you write when you want to d structure nested values.

81
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:26,540
Right.

82
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:34,160
So by going colon and then another D structure bracket we're saying I want you to give me this value

83
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,850
off of the user which is being destructor off of the state.

84
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:47,660
So similarly we will do that off of the cart and we want to hit in value and then instead of this we

85
00:08:47,660 --> 00:09:02,920
can now just do that and now pull the hidden value off and we can just selectively render this based

86
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:06,370
off of a ternary operator.

87
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:13,450
So if it's hidden if it is true then I want to render nothing but if it's not then render the cart dropdown

88
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:14,680
component.

89
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:25,700
And now if we look we can see that we can toggle our dropdown now before we add our add item feature

90
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:32,110
to our cart and to our application let's commit our code.

91
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:47,590
We know that what we are adding is our cart icon added cart icon and cart dropdown components to our

92
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:55,060
application also implemented heart reducer

93
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:01,690
and then let's push and continue with our had item.
