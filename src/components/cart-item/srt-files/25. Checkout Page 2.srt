1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:05,410
Now what we need to build next is our checkout page.

2
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:10,780
We have to start styling it and also creating the checkout items.

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:17,690
Now looking at the final products for our checkout page we see that there will be a total some checkout

4
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:18,590
items.

5
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:25,300
This header as well as this section here that has to do with payment with stripe.

6
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:30,740
Now we'll take this one part of the time and let's actually build our base page first.

7
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:38,710
So let's have this total and then let's have this header as well as the checkout items which we'll tackle

8
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,080
after.

9
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:43,880
So let's just first build the checkout page.

10
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:49,190
Now what we know that we need from the checkout page will be the header first.

11
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:52,720
So let's just build that out now.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,160
I already have the styles for you but we'll explore a little bit after we set up the base HD Himmel

13
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:02,830
elements for this.

14
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:11,690
We need a class name of checkout page and inside of our checkout page will be our checkout header

15
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:22,480
so it will just be a div that hold some of these block like elements together and these block elements

16
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,160
are called header blocks

17
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:35,570
and inside of them is a span that has some text regarding what it will say and it will be respectively.

18
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:39,920
Product Description Quantity Price and remove.

19
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:49,570
So let's copy this over actually four more times for each block and this one will say Product

20
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:53,400
Description

21
00:01:59,350 --> 00:01:59,770
Oh sorry.

22
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:00,680
This is quantity

23
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:06,900
and finally remove

24
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,170
for the actual styling.

25
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:18,600
I have them as normal so you can just paste them into your style sheet.

26
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,190
And let's take a quick look at what we're doing here.

27
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:28,260
The main thing to focus on is that our checkout header is 100 percent of the page and the page itself

28
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:32,700
is fifty five percent of the total that is available to it.

29
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:40,830
So for us that's why it's centered in this quantity amount and it's responsive accordingly but each

30
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:48,300
header block inside of our header is twenty three percent of the total width except for the last child

31
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:54,420
which is our last header block which is 8 percent so twenty three times four is ninety two plus eight

32
00:02:54,450 --> 00:03:01,200
gives us a hundred and the reason for this is because our remove only holds the X button so it doesn't

33
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,330
need as much space as the other header blocks inside of our header.

34
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:13,200
But now that we have our header component let's actually bring in our cart items from our state and

35
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,080
then we'll build our checkout item and finish this page.

36
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:20,310
So let's just first bring in all the things that we need.

37
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:26,630
So we need connect from reactor redux.

38
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:34,580
We also need create structured selector from re selected because we know we're gonna be pulling some

39
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:44,030
stuff off the state and then we're going to bring in our actual select cart items from redux

40
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:51,620
parts selectors and we'll pull off select cart items

41
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:05,090
now let's write our map states props maps state props which will be our create structured selector and

42
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:12,350
we'll pass it in as carte items GOES TO SELECT CARD items now as far as the total goes.

43
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:20,640
We need another selector for it that will add all of the price of our items together that selector.

44
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:31,230
We will add to our cart selector and we'll say we'll call it expert contest select cart total.

45
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:33,880
Yeah like our total.

46
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,770
That sounds pretty good.

47
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:43,520
And what we'll need is we'll need all of our car items and it's going to be very similar to our reduce

48
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,430
the previous one we had four items count.

49
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:52,780
The only difference is that we're going to be accumulating the value of the price of the card at a plot

50
00:04:52,790 --> 00:05:00,230
price times the item quantity so we can actually copy this over and just modify it so

51
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:07,140
because the main thing we're trying to get is the total cost right.

52
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:10,910
And we know the cost of each item and we know how many of each item we have.

53
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:16,840
So it's pretty much just going to be the quantity multiplied by the price.

54
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,410
So now let's bring this into our component

55
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:34,410
and then we'll say the total value is this and then let's connect it together and we'll add our maps

56
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:35,380
stage props

57
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:44,090
and then D structure off both the car items that were passing in now as well as the total

58
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:57,530
and now what we can do right after our header component is we can put a quick little map right of our

59
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:58,370
car items

60
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:04,010
and we'll just show the name for now before we build our component.

61
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:09,770
But let's just make sure that the parts that we can control for now are working and we just want to

62
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:20,270
render a car item Donny and then after this we're gonna have a div that has the class name of total

63
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,220
and inside will be the span

64
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:39,370
that has our total and now we save and if we look we'll see that because we have no items right.

65
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:43,270
Our total is zero but once we add our items in

66
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:52,530
we'll see that our total is updating and there's the name of our items cool.

67
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:58,650
So nothing new nothing really that different from what we've done so far but now we have our checkout

68
00:06:58,650 --> 00:06:59,850
page.

69
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:01,260
So let's build our checkout item.
