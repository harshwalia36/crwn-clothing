1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:05,820
OK now let's create our cart item component.

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:12,990
Now we know that the items that our cart item components will be getting will be the same item as the

3
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:21,220
one that we display in our collection items because in our collection items we get an image url.

4
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:26,930
We get the price we get the name and then we also now know we'll get a quantity.

5
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:32,910
Because we'll be pulling that item off from our state.

6
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:41,640
So what we're gonna do keeping in mind these properties is first we're going to make our component so

7
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:50,220
we'll make a cart item component and create our usual files our cart item component digests X and our

8
00:00:50,220 --> 00:01:03,420
cart item styles does SOF and inside of our car item component we need our react from react and we'll

9
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:13,250
also need our cart item styles and now what we're going to set as our car item will be a functional

10
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:20,330
component where we'll d structure off those properties that we need from our item but we'll probably

11
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:29,110
pass the whole item through so we're gonna get the item and off of it we want the image URL we want

12
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:32,330
the price and we also want the name

13
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:48,330
and what we'll do is we will return a div with the class name of cart item.

14
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:57,080
We're also going to need an image where the source points to our image euro and for the old key we'll

15
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:09,830
just say that it's an item and then inside of our div we can say this thing is our item details container

16
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:18,470
because looking at the actual component on the left side is our image but on the right side is our details

17
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:27,860
so here we're gonna have a span with the class name of name or we'll display the name

18
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:36,130
and then we'll have the same thing except for price where we'll have the price

19
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:47,400
with our dollar sign and now let's export this as the default

20
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,210
and we'll also need our quantity which we know will also get

21
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:06,990
the structure that off and we can just explicitly say quantity times this amount.

22
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:19,670
So now if we look at our cart item styles I have also provided for you the styling here and now we just

23
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:28,940
need to import the car item into our cart component cart dropdown so let's import in our new cart item

24
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:40,860
and in our cart dropdown we need to display it inside of this div but we need access to those cart items.

25
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:46,750
So what we're gonna do is we're going to pull them off using connect off of our retail store

26
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:55,540
and what we will write is our maps date to props

27
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:10,510
equals are function where we get state and what little return is carte items which will go to state

28
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:12,450
actually.

29
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:14,490
Let's just d structure it off state.

30
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:17,340
So we need cart and then off cart.

31
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:24,520
We need cart items and we can just have it horse cart items like this.

32
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:34,600
What connect with our map stage props and now we'll d structure our cart items here.

33
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:46,180
And inside of our car items we can map out our cart items.

34
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:49,840
So cart items that map but the cart.

35
00:04:49,840 --> 00:05:00,940
Item and we will render our car item component where the key goes to our cart.

36
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:06,210
Item I.D. and item is the cart.

37
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:06,440
Item

38
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:14,450
got to be careful that casing okay.

39
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:21,870
And now if we look at our actual code we open up our component.

40
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:32,310
And if we add our item there it is we're able to now add as many items as we want and we have them displayed

41
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:32,610
here.

42
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:40,680
So in a similar way once we make our checkout page it'll be pretty much the same thing.

43
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:47,670
We add the items we'll pull them into the component and we'll display them this pattern.

44
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:55,130
Now we've seen a couple of times now is hopefully very very easy to write.

45
00:05:55,170 --> 00:06:00,720
You can see that once you get used to writing the code in the reduced hours there's not much complexity

46
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:07,580
when it comes to how to separate out your code that's kind of the amazing thing about redux is that

47
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:14,930
it just follows our unit directional data flow pattern that we need and we need to think about when

48
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:17,060
writing our real code.

49
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:25,000
We have these actions that trigger state changes and then using that state we pull them into our components

50
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:33,110
and then we display the respective elements that we need so we will do this a couple more times but

51
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:40,920
hopefully by now you can see the benefit of what redux does for us and this pattern.

52
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:56,130
OK so now that we have our card dropdown let's commit our code Stannis and get commit created cart item

53
00:06:56,130 --> 00:07:00,900
component and connected our cart dropdown

54
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,760
cart items reducer

55
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:13,080
awesome.

56
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:14,090
Now let's continue.
