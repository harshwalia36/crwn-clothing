1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:09,540
Now that we have our cart selectors let's actually convert our user map state to props selectors to

2
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:20,490
also use re select so let's make a new user dot selector digest and let's actually look at what we're

3
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:28,410
pulling on if I remember correctly our header component uses it and all it gets is the current user

4
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:36,570
so at this point it might as well just be worth it for us to memorize the selectors using both a hidden

5
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:46,780
selector as well for cart and our current user selector for our user so we'll import in our create selector

6
00:00:49,120 --> 00:01:00,340
from re select and we're just going to get our state selector select the user equal state which for

7
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:13,910
sure is state DOT user and then export const select current user equals create selector and as you remember

8
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:24,340
the first argument can be either an array of our input selectors and then our last argument being the

9
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:28,260
function that gets the return of this input selector.

10
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:34,570
So our user reducer and then we'll return user to current user.

11
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:41,890
Now another thing is actually let's say we imagine we had another selector like say we wanted to also

12
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:45,530
pull off our hidden right.

13
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:55,640
So we had a select cart and then let's say we needed the cart hit in value with our user value for some

14
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,540
reason right.

15
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:01,790
I don't really know but you can imagine where we would come up with a case where we might want to use

16
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:07,890
multiple inputs selectors and as we know from our last example we would get cart like this where we

17
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:10,970
would be able to use it in some kind of way.

18
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:16,080
But there's another way that you can actually structure your create selector where instead of passing

19
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:24,450
in an array you just pass it in as arguments in successive order the function in the animal still remain

20
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:25,140
the same.

21
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:31,110
So you can either pass all of your inputs selectors in in the order that you want them to appear what

22
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:38,790
their outputs inside of are function parameters or we can just pass them in as an array.

23
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:40,620
It really makes no difference.

24
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:45,800
Personally I like to use the array but it doesn't really matter.

25
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:48,280
So let's get rid of this because we don't need it.

26
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:58,820
So now we have our current user let's also make the one for r hidden and we'll just export contest select

27
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:12,880
cart hidden equals create selector with our select cart selector and then we'll just return cart Doc

28
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:16,200
cart hidden part Doc cart hidden.

29
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:22,100
OK and now let's start replacing the components we have with the respective selectors

30
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:37,700
we'll import also in another thing called create structured selector from re select and I'll show you

31
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:41,540
what that does in a second once we bring in our respective selectors

32
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:52,310
and we want select cart hidden and we also want select current user

33
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:08,290
select current user so how we've seen this done before was where we would pass in our state into our

34
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,100
selectors right.

35
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:11,530
So let's say we want a current user.

36
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:20,050
Well we would take the whole state and then say current user points to our select current user.

37
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:26,770
And then we pass the state of now we know that for hidden it's pretty much the same thing we will call

38
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:30,180
a select card hidden and then pass in the state.

39
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:35,460
But if we have five six selectors or pretty much just doing the exact same thing five six times.

40
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:35,760
Right.

41
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:40,260
So what we can actually do is use our create structured selector call

42
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:53,120
and instead of passing it as a function we just pass it like so where the properties that we want point

43
00:04:53,120 --> 00:05:00,060
to the correct selector and then create structure selector will automatically pass are top level state

44
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:07,800
that we get as our map states props into each subsequent selector and now if we look at our head our

45
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:12,360
component we'll see that our code should remain the same.

46
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:19,030
We still get our current user inside of our state and it's being passed in

47
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:27,180
and we are card hidden and still works as usual.

48
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:33,320
Now let's see where else we have any map states of props being called objects.

49
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,800
We can do this here to

50
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:38,980
import in

51
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,430
from redux.

52
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:48,130
User selectors select current user

53
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:58,310
now even though we only have one selected property that we're passing into our maps it's props.

54
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:05,950
We should still use create structured selector because if in the future we do need to pull in more then

55
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:10,810
it's easy because we've already converted our code over to using create structured selector

56
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:22,520
and the main benefit of using it is just that it extends us a little bit less code rewrite than we would

57
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,450
normally have to do

58
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:29,400
select current user.

59
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:36,000
Now let's actually use create structure selector and all of our other components like our card dropdown

60
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:47,800
so we've got to import our create structured selector and then we can just replace this part of our

61
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:56,440
code and take out the state and then the last one is I believe cart icon.

62
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:57,280
Yes

63
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:05,790
and then same thing

64
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:12,020
OK.

65
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:23,190
And now if we look our code still all works the same but now we are able to memorize all of our selector.

66
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:30,040
OK so moving forward now all of our code is going to be written with re select regarding our selectors

67
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:39,070
and this is actually the most common practice when using redux inside of a react application while also

68
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:40,420
using re select.
