1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:08,970
Now the next thing we're going to tackle is a pretty big feature and the feature is our cart.

2
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:17,850
So if we go to our final application we'll see that our cart is represented as this shopping bag icon

3
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:23,670
with a number inside that increases whenever you add items to it.

4
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:33,440
Inside when you click this icon it will create this dropdown that shows you the items that you currently

5
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,900
have in your cart.

6
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:43,070
Now we have to keep in mind how we're going to store these items because if we go to our checkout we

7
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:45,920
also see the same items.

8
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:53,240
And if we start increasing the quantity here we actually see that our shopping icon is also increasing

9
00:00:53,240 --> 00:01:02,470
in that number so this seems like it's two places in the application that uses the same state which

10
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:09,370
is perfect for what we know about redux because we know that these two components are going to share

11
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:12,270
the same state.

12
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:15,270
Now how do we build this.

13
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:17,440
Well there's a lot going on here.

14
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:24,750
So in this section we're going to put together a lot of the concepts that we just learned and expand

15
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:34,550
upon them to build this exciting feature so let's go back to our application code and what we first

16
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:40,660
need to do is bring in the actual SPG for the shopping bag icon.

17
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:46,580
Now I've already provided it for you so you can just add it into this folder of our assets

18
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:55,560
and inside of our assets you are just going to drop the SPG and so I'm just going to copy and paste

19
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:09,010
it in and then what we'll do is make the actual car icon component that represents both the icon and

20
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:10,100
the number.

21
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:18,740
So when our components let's make a cart icon component an inside will need our cart icon component

22
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:28,370
dodgy OSX and our cart icon dot styles dot size.

23
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:39,480
So first of all import in react from react will import in our style she and we're also going to import

24
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:41,500
in our shopping icon.

25
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:55,850
So we're gonna do react component as shopping icon from and then the year all of our SPG assets shopping

26
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:59,030
backed up that's.

27
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:01,920
Now what we're gonna write is a concept.

28
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:15,140
Carl Icahn equals a functional component that renders a div and this div is going to have the class

29
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:30,020
name of cart icon because it will hold both our shopping icon as well as our span that will represent

30
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:35,440
our total number of items.

31
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:41,080
Now for this span we're just going to say item count as its class name.

32
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:47,980
And for our shopping icon we're gonna give it the class name of shopping icon

33
00:03:50,750 --> 00:04:00,110
and then let's export out by default our cart icon is spelled Defoe.

34
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:08,020
Now I have provided for you the styling for this card icon as I usually do and you can just paste this

35
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:16,030
into your cart icon styles but all I'm doing is I'm pretty much just setting our item count to be positioned

36
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:21,500
above and absolutely in the middle of our shopping icon.

37
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:29,160
So now let's bring this into our header component.

38
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:40,830
Now let's import in cart icon from cart icon card icon component and let's just drop it at the very

39
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:44,400
end of our header.

40
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:51,290
Now if we save and look at our code we see that we have our kite icon now right now.

41
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:59,080
None of that functionality is tied to it but we have our icon component in the next section.

42
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:06,960
We are going to actually start building out the dropdown and all of the redux that's going to be associated

43
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,890
to setting that up.
