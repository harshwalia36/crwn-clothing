1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:01,900
All right.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,640
It's time to get started with a new section.

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:11,840
We've built our app now to have sign in and sign up functionality but things are starting to get a little

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,070
bit complicated.

5
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:18,100
You see react is a UI library.

6
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:23,430
It's focusing on the UI as our apps get more and more complicated.

7
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,280
Our state is going to grow.

8
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:27,920
It's going to get more and more complicated.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:36,240
And in this section we're going to use a new library called redux to make our ReACT state more scalable.

10
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:42,950
Now Redux is a pretty tough topic to understand especially if you haven't learned it before.

11
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:49,420
But the key thing in this section as we progress through the videos which you may have to revisit a

12
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:53,420
couple of times because there'll be some new terms that we haven't heard before.

13
00:00:53,800 --> 00:01:02,590
But the key takeaway of this section is to understand that our app as it grows becomes more and more

14
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:06,330
hard to understand how the flow of data is.

15
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:12,340
And at the end of the day programs are way for us to manage the flow of data.

16
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:20,870
And if you remember are key to being a good react developer is to decide the state and where it lives.

17
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,900
And this section is all about that.

18
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:33,380
We're going to be using redux as a state management to really focus on this point so that our code becomes

19
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:41,780
cleaner our app becomes easier to debug and you'll notice that although redux may be confusing to understand

20
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:49,070
our app will become easier and easier to understand and how data flows because of redux.

21
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:50,540
So stick with us.

22
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:56,030
I know this is gonna be a tough section but state management is a big big topic.

23
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:03,410
As a matter of fact in this course we're going to talk about things like context API and graph QoL which

24
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,910
are different ways to manage state as well we have lots to get through.

25
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:08,740
So let's get started.
